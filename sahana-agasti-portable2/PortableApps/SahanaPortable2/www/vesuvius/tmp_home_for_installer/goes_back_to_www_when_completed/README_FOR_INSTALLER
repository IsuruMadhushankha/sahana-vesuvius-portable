1). Get the codebase.(you have it already, since you're reading this?)

2). Place the vesuvius directory in the web root directory. 

3). Create a new MYSQL database on your server. Assign a new user to the database. Please keep in mind the database name you created and also the accessing 
	information of the database.

5). Then in the terminal go inside the vesuvius root directory that placed inside the web root directory. You have to set the permissions to the www/,conf/,
	backups/ and 3rd/ directories using the following commands in the terminal. Execute the below commands one by one in the terminal. In each command if you
	are promoted to give the password then give it in the terminal.
	
	sudo chmod -R 777 www/
	sudo chmod -R 777 conf/
	sudo chmod -R 755 backups/
	sudo chmod -R 777 3rd/
